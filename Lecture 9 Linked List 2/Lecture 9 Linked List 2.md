## Midpoint of LL
Calculate the mid of LL without finding the length

Use slow/fast pointers

Implemented in [midpointLL.cpp](./midpointLL.cpp)

## Merge two sorted LL
Same scenario as the merging two sorted arrays, just the catch is, create a new LL, i.e., create new Nodes everytime.

Implemented in [MergeTwoSortedLL.cpp](./MergeTwoSortedLL.cpp)

## Merge Sort LL
Divide and Conquer

Just the same age old merge sort, Use the previous two functions to get the sorted list.

First break in halves, then merge two sorted list.

Implemented in [mergeSortLL.cpp](./MergeSortLL.cpp)
